By definition, \"leaf nodes\" in a game tree are nodes that don't have nodes below them.\n\nIn the ConnectX competition, the game trees will be much larger!  \n\nTo see this, consider a minimax agent that is trying to plan its first move, where all columns in the game board are  empty.

Remember that with this algorithm, \n> The agent chooses moves to get a score that is as high as possible, and it assumes the opponent will counteract this by choosing moves to force the score to be as low as possible.\n\nConsider the toy example below of a game tree that the agent will use to select its next move.  \n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QlfWGM9.png\" width=80%><br/>\n</center>\n\nWhich move will the agent select?

But this is almost never the case, in practice: it's far more likely for the agent to encounter a suboptimal (that is: worse than optimal) opponent.  \n\nSay the minimax agent encounters a suboptimal opponent. Should we expect the minimax agent to still play the game well, despite the contradiction with its assumptions?

Use the next code cell to define an agent.  (You can see an example of how to write a valid agent in **[this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/create-a-connectx-agent)**.)\n\nIf you decide to use the minimax code from the tutorial, you might like to add [**alpha-beta pruning**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) to decrease the computation time (i.e., get the minimax algorithm to run much faster!).  In this case, \"alpha\" and \"beta\" to refer to two values that are maintained while the algorithm is running, that help to identify early stopping conditions.  \n\nWithout alpha-beta pruning, minimax evaluates each leaf node.  With alpha-beta pruning, minimax only evaluates nodes that could provide information that affects the agent's choice of action.  Put another way, it identifies nodes that could not possibly affect the final result and avoids evaluating them.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def my_agent(obs, config):\n    import random\n    \n    # How deep to make the game tree: higher values take longer to run!\n    N_STEPS = 3\n    \n    # Helper function for minimax: calculates value of heuristic for grid\n    def get_heuristic(grid, mark, config):\n        num_threes = count_windows(grid, 3, mark, config)\n        num_fours = count_windows(grid, 4, mark, config)\n        num_threes_opp = count_windows(grid, 3, mark%2+1, config)\n        num_fours_opp = count_windows(grid, 4, mark%2+1, config)\n        score = num_threes -
