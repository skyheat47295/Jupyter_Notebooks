This tiring and repetitive work requires an expert eye. Your team wants to create a technology solution that helps pathologists with this task in real-time, using a camera. However, due to the complexity of the work, your team has not found rule-based systems to be capable of adding value to the review of images. \n\nWould AI add value to a potential solution?
